# flyglia

We profiled single-cell RNAseq using plate-based Smart-seq2 platform (Picelli et al. 2014). Cells are from  young and old Drosophila glial cells of two populations: Repo-GAL4+ pan glia and GMR56F03-GAL4+ ensheathing glia. 

The scRNAseq dataset of the whole brain was obtained from https://scope.aertslab.org/#/1b22e6fe-f9a6-4c8b-bfa7-e1d127b12296/*/welcome (Davie et al., 2018 Cell).
